# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors: "During traffic distribution test, the canary deployment received slightly varying traffic than expected (25% instead of 20%). This could be due to the ingress controller's load balancing algorithm."
  suggested_improvements: "Simulate errors (0.1% of the time) in app.py caused no visible errors during testing. Consider increasing error rate for better testing."
